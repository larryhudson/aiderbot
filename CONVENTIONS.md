# Python Coding Conventions

This document outlines the coding conventions for our Python project. Following these guidelines will help ensure that our codebase remains clean, maintainable, and easy to reason about.

## General Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Always strive for simplicity in your code. Simple code is easier to understand, maintain, and debug.
2. **Readability**: Write code that is easy to read and understand. Code is read more often than it is written.
3. **Consistency**: Follow these conventions consistently throughout the project.
4. **Step-by-Step Thinking**: Approach problem-solving and coding in a step-by-step manner.

## Specific Guidelines

### 1. Code Layout

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for code layout.
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs).
- Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
- Surround top-level functions and classes with two blank lines.
- Use blank lines sparingly inside functions to indicate logical sections.

### 2. Naming Conventions

- Use `snake_case` for function and variable names.
- Use `PascalCase` for class names.
- Use `UPPER_CASE` for constants.
- Choose descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.

### 3. Functions

- Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
- Use docstrings to describe what the function does, its parameters, and return values.
- Limit the number of parameters in a function. If a function requires many parameters, consider using a class.

### 4. Classes

- Use classes to group related data and functions.
- Keep classes focused on a single responsibility.
- Use inheritance sparingly; favor composition over inheritance.

### 5. Comments and Documentation

- Write self-documenting code where possible.
- Use comments to explain "why" not "what". The code should be clear enough to explain what it's doing.
- Use docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods.

### 6. Error Handling

- Use exceptions for error handling.
- Be specific with exception types.
- Always clean up resources (e.g., file handles, network connections) using context managers (`with` statements) or `try`/`finally` blocks.

### 7. Imports

- Place imports at the top of the file.
- Group imports in the following order: standard library imports, third-party imports, local application imports.
- Use absolute imports.

### 8. Testing

- Write unit tests for all functions and methods.
- Aim for high test coverage, but focus on testing critical and complex parts of the code.
- Use meaningful names for test functions, describing the scenario being tested.

### 9. Version Control

- Make small, focused commits.
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Use feature branches for developing new features or fixing bugs.

### 10. Step-by-Step Approach

When tackling a problem or implementing a feature:

1. Understand the requirements clearly.
2. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
3. Implement one step at a time.
4. Test each step before moving to the next.
5. Refactor and optimize only after the basic implementation is working.

Remember, these conventions are guidelines to help write better code. They should be applied with thought and can be adapted as needed for specific project requirements.
