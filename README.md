# Aiderbot

Aiderbot is a GitHub App that uses [Aider](https://aider.chat/) and [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet) to automatically create pull requests to resolve issues and respond to pull request review comments.

## How it works

This GitHub App automates the process of addressing issues and responding to pull request review comments. Here's an overview of how it works:

1. It uses a webhook to listen for GitHub repository events:
   - When a new issue is created
   - When a new pull request review comment is added
   - The app 'reacts' to the new issue / pull request review comment with the ðŸ‘€ reaction to show that it is working.

2. It clones the repository to a temporary directory:
   - When an event is triggered, the app clones the repository to a temporary directory.
   - It uses Aider to run an LLM (Language Model) prompt that analyzes the issue or review comment and makes the necessary changes to the code.

3. Using Aider, it attempts to resolve the issue by making code changes.
   - It uses Aider's 'repo map' feature to choose which files it needs to edit.
   - Aider automatically creates a commit for each change it makes.

3. It pushes its changes to a new branch:
   - After making changes, the app creates a new branch in the repository.
   - It then pushes the new branch to GitHub.
   - Then it creates an issue comment that describes the pull request.

This automated workflow helps streamline the process of addressing issues and incorporating feedback, saving time for developers and maintainers.

To trigger Aiderbot's action, you need to mention "@Aiderbot" in the issue title or body, or in the pull request review comment. This ensures that Aiderbot only responds when explicitly called upon.

## Celery Task Queue

The application uses Celery, a distributed task queue, to manage and execute code analysis and modification tasks asynchronously. This allows the app to handle multiple requests simultaneously and remain responsive while time-consuming tasks are processed in the background.

This is an experiment and is still in early development, so expect bugs!

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the GitHub App, ensure you have the following:

- GitHub account
- Docker - e.g. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), [OrbStack for macOS](https://orbstack.dev/)
- Node.js and NPM - for running the Smee webhook server in local development
- Anthropic API token for Claude 3.5 model
- macOS Sonoma 14.3.1 or later (Note: This has been tested on macOS, but should work on other operating systems)

## Setup instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the GitHub App, and get the webhook server running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository and set up the environment:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. **Set up a webhook URL with [Smee.io](https://smee.io/):**
   - Visit [Smee.io](https://smee.io/) and click "Start a new channel"
   - Keep this page open, you'll need the webhook URL in the next step

3. **[Set up a new GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps):**
   - Go to your GitHub account settings > Developer settings > GitHub Apps > New GitHub App
   - Fill in the required fields
   - Under 'Webhook', set the webhook URL to the one you created with Smee
   - [Generate a random string](https://www.random.org/strings/?num=10&len=32&digits=on&upperalpha=on&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=html&rnd=new) and set it as the 'Webhook secret'
   - Under 'Repository permissions', set 'Issues', 'Pull requests' and 'Contents' to 'Read & write'
   - Under 'Subscribe to events', check 'Issues' and 'Pull request review comment'
   - Create the app
   - Under 'Private keys', generate a new private key and download it
   - Store the `.pem` file in the project directory

4. **Set up the environment variables:**
   - Duplicate `.env.sample` to `.env`
   - Replace the placeholder values in `.env`:
     - `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: the 'Webhook secret' string you generated
     - `GITHUB_APP_ID`: App ID at the top of the app settings
     - `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`: relative path to .pem file (e.g., 'private-key.pem')
     - `GITHUB_APP_USER_NAME`: The name of your GitHub app, followed by '[bot]' (e.g., 'MyCustomAiderbot[bot]')
     - `GIT_COMMIT_AUTHOR_NAME` and `GIT_COMMIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`: your details which will be used in Aider's commits. You can find your public-facing GitHub email address in the [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/emails).
     - `CONVENTIONS_FILE_PATH`: (Optional) Set this to the path of a Markdown file within your repository that contains project-specific coding conventions. If set, Aider will use these conventions when making coding changes.

5. **Set up project-specific conventions (Optional):**
   - If you want Aider to follow specific coding conventions for your project, create a Markdown file in your repository (e.g., `CONVENTIONS.md`).
   - In this file, describe your project's coding standards, best practices, and any other guidelines you want Aider to follow.
   - Set the `CONVENTIONS_FILE_PATH` environment variable to the path of this file relative to your repository root.
   - You can look at the `CONVENTIONS.md` file in this repository as an example of how to structure your project-specific conventions.

6. **Install the App:**
   - In the left sidebar of the app settings, click 'Install App'
   - Choose the repositories you want to enable it for

6. **Run the application:**
   - Build the Docker containers and run them:
     ```
     docker compose up -d
     ```
   - In a fourth terminal, start Smee to forward webhook requests:
     ```
     npx smee -u <your-smee-webhook-url> -t http://localhost:5000/webhook
     ```

7. **Test the App:**
   - Create a new issue in a repository where the app is installed
   - The app should react to the issue with the 'eyes' reaction, then create a PR to resolve the issue
   - Check the Flask dev server logs and Celery worker logs if you encounter any issues

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any problems, check the following:

- Ensure all environment variables in `.env` are correctly set
- Verify that the webhook URL in the GitHub App settings matches your Smee URL
- Check that the Smee client is running and forwarding requests
- Review the Flask dev server logs for any error messages

### Testing and Debugging Tips

- **Smee.io Redeliver Feature**: Within the Smee.io interface, you can use the 'Redeliver' button to resend a payload. This is particularly useful for testing after you've made changes or fixed a bug. Instead of manually creating new issues or PR review comments repeatedly, you can simply click 'Redeliver' to test your latest changes with the same payload.

For more detailed information, refer to the [GitHub Apps documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps).
